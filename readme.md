### About journey

The initial inspiration for this mode was, recreating my original Cities Skylines 3D assets in the new **metalness** workflow that Surviving Mars supports and is now an industry standard. Also it was an interesting challenge to motivate myself to get into programming.

The progress has been slow but there has been progress & the process of wrapping my mind around all the programming concepts has been interesting, challenging and confusing for the most part. :)

In the end, this has become a learning experience that I will continue to work on whenever is possible.
